# FreePPlus
Create advanced Excel spreadsheets using .NET, without the need of interop.

FreePPlus is a .NET library that reads and writes Excel files using the Office Open XML format (xlsx). 
FreePPlus has one dependency other than .NET - the CodeBrix.Imaging package for image and font handling.

FreePPlus is provided as a .NET 10 library and associated `FreePPlus.LgplLicenseForever` NuGet package.
FreePPlus supports applications and assemblies that target Microsoft .NET version 10.0 and later.

Microsoft .NET version 10.0 is a Long-Term Supported (LTS) version of .NET, and was released on Nov 11, 
2025; and will be actively supported by Microsoft until Nov 14, 2028. Please update your C#/.NET code
